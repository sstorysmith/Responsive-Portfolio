I am launching from inside the firewall, with a comuter science degree and experience with a proprietary system
(IBM AS/400) [Object oriented, db2 relational database, security, disaster recovery,
communications, RPG programmin, Control Language, application development, data warehousing].


The trilogy-UT bootcamp gave me insight into the otherside of the firewall. Today's implementation of
that necessary cooperation between two systems is called client/server. The fundamentals of
logic, function and user interfaces I've learned to coded with javascript and HTML. The world of open-source has 
expanded my resources for both learning and creating - pulling and pushing code from github enables mass 
sharing of ideas and code from around the world.

Security? On the proprieatray system I could ensure integrity and protected environments. Today, the focus on 
openess has presented a world where it's difficult and often impossible to make finite statements about security and 
unprecedented effort and cost goes into attempting to create secure applications and environments. The dollars
and man hours associated with this has impacted our resources for pushing into new ideas and capital investments.
